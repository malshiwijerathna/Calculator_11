# Calculator

This project implements a simple calculator using the [JAC Language](https://www.jac-lang.org), which is designed for learning and writing interpretable programs easily in the browser.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Input handling through function calls
- Output printed to the console
- Simple, clear logic using JAC syntax

## What This Demonstrates

- Step 5 (scale-agnostic): num_operations controls how many times the loop runs.
- Step 6 (MTLLM integration): ai_helper walker uses think to invoke AI logic and help users when the input is invalid.
